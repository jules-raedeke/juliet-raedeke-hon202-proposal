  <h1>Methods and Design</h1>
  <body>
   <h2>Method: How would you collect the data and why?</h2>
    <h4>Describe the general methodology you choose for your study, in order to test your hypothesis(es).</h4>
      <p>I will be gathering data on a cause/effect relationship between colleges/universities and their undergraduate students. I will be collecting qualitative and quantitative data for my hypothesis through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Thus, I will be gathering primary and descriptive data. As stated below in my participants section, I will be sampling undergraduate students ages 18-24 from colleges/universities in Portland, OR. I will be involved in every aspect of the research–including survey creation, survey distribution, interviewing, transcription of said interviews, and leading focus groups. 
      </p>
    <h4>Explain why this method is the best for your purposes.</h4>
      <p>I want to conduct a survey to get a large amount of more general data from college/university students on their opinions about college/university. This survey will be promoted via email, flyers, and social media to undergraduate college/university students who attend schools in Portland, OR. Surveys will also include questions collecting demographic information for analysis. 
      </p>
      <p>I want to personally interview individuals from my sample group in order to collect specific, individual opinions about college/university. These interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim, as I want to be able to code for underlying emotion and subtle cues, which an intelligent or edited transcription would not provide me with. Interviews will be no more than 20 minutes in length, and I will select 20 interviewees from my survey sample (surveys will have a yes/no question regarding interest in doing a follow-up interview with me).
      </p>
      <p>I want to hold two focus groups composed of people from my sample group–like the interviews, there will be a yes/no question on surveys regarding interest in attending one of these focus groups. Each focus group will have 10 participants; participants will be prompted with questions (by me) about their attitudes and experiences within their college/university. Probably 3-5 questions will be asked. Focus groups will not exceed 45 minutes in length, and will be recorded and transcribed verbatim.
      </p>
      <p>Primary data is the most relevant to my research question, as it is based on the opinions and experiences of individuals and the impact they feel those opinions/experiences have on their attitude toward college/university education. Descriptive data is the most relevant to my research as well; I want to know about the specific feelings and experiences of my sample group in order to come to more general conclusions.
      </p>
    <h4>Participants: Who would you test and why?</h4>
      <p>I would be collecting data from students who are already enrolled at colleges or universities (public or private); in this case, specifically from colleges and universities in Portland, OR, such as Portland State University, University of Portland, Reed College, Lewis and Clark College, Pacific Northwest College of Art, and Portland Community College.
      </p>
    <h4>Describe the sample you would test and explain why you have chosen this sample. Include age, and language background and socio-economic information, if relevant to the design.</h4>
      <p>I will be sampling undergraduate students from these institutions, because undergrad potentially has the largest pool of students to sample from. Also, those getting their masters or their doctorates sometimes have more financial aid from the school or perhaps don’t pay tuition at all; I am trying to focus specifically on students who are trying to attain their bachelor’s. I would sample ages 18-24, because the majority of public and private four-year institutions are made up of 18-24-year olds (Age Distribution of Undergraduate Students, by Type of Institution | The Hamilton Project, 2017). Socioeconomic status is irrelevant to sampling consideration but will be recorded in my survey. Same with language background; I will be recording what languages students speak and their first languages/languages spoken at home.
      </p>
    <h4>Are there any participants you would exclude? Why, why not?</h4>
      <p>I don’t think so, other than masters/doctoral students for reasons stated above–but even so, if a masters/doctoral student wanted to share their experiences with me, I would consider it. The undergraduate population is just likely to have been impacted more by the pandemic and how colleges/universities have responded to that, so it makes my sampling pool larger.
      </p>
   <h2>Design: What would the stimuli look like and why?</h2>
    <h4>Describe what kinds of manipulations/variations you would make or test for in order to test your hypothesis(es).</h4>
      <p>I think I could potentially send out a second survey with questions pertaining more to the responses I received during the first round. I think this would expand upon my initial data in a productive and specific way, as I would get more nuanced data the second time around. I could also do another round of focus groups, but group participants who expressed similar opinions in the same groups. I think this could provide an interesting support/rebuttal dynamic between a group that agrees with my hypothesis and one that does not.
