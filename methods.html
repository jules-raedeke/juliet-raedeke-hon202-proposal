  <h1>Methods and Design</h1>
  <body>
   <h2>Method: How would you collect the data and why?</h2>
    <h4>Describe the general methodology you choose for your study, in order to test your hypothesis(es).</h4>
      <p>I will be gathering data on a cause/effect relationship between colleges/universities and their undergraduate students. I will be collecting qualitative and quantitative data for my hypothesis through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Thus, I will be gathering primary and descriptive data. As stated below in my participants section, I will be sampling undergraduate students ages 18-24 from colleges/universities in Portland, OR. I will be involved in every aspect of the research–including survey creation, survey distribution, interviewing, transcription of said interviews, and leading focus groups. 
      </p>
    <h4>Explain why this method is the best for your purposes.</h4>
      <p>I want to conduct a survey to get a large amount of more general data from college/university students on their opinions about college/university. This survey will be promoted via email, flyers, and social media to undergraduate college/university students who attend schools in Portland, OR. Surveys will also include questions collecting demographic information for analysis. 
      </p>
      <p>I want to personally interview individuals from my sample group in order to collect specific, individual opinions about college/university. These interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim, as I want to be able to code for underlying emotion and subtle cues, which an intelligent or edited transcription would not provide me with. Interviews will be no more than 20 minutes in length, and I will select 20 interviewees from my survey sample (surveys will have a yes/no question regarding interest in doing a follow-up interview with me).
      </p>
      <p>I want to hold two focus groups composed of people from my sample group–like the interviews, there will be a yes/no question on surveys regarding interest in attending one of these focus groups. Each focus group will have 10 participants; participants will be prompted with questions (by me) about their attitudes and experiences within their college/university. Probably 3-5 questions will be asked. Focus groups will not exceed 45 minutes in length, and will be recorded and transcribed verbatim.
      </p>
      <p>Primary data is the most relevant to my research question, as it is based on the opinions and experiences of individuals and the impact they feel those opinions/experiences have on their attitude toward college/university education. Descriptive data is the most relevant to my research as well; I want to know about the specific feelings and experiences of my sample group in order to come to more general conclusions.
      </p>
    <h4>Participants: Who would you test and why?</h4>
      <p>I would be collecting data from students who are already enrolled at colleges or universities (public or private); in this case, specifically from colleges and universities in Portland, OR, such as Portland State University, University of Portland, Reed College, Lewis and Clark College, Pacific Northwest College of Art, and Portland Community College.
      </p>
    <h4>Describe the sample you would test and explain why you have chosen this sample. Include age, and language background and socio-economic information, if relevant to the design.</h4>
      <p>I will be sampling undergraduate students from these institutions, because undergrad potentially has the largest pool of students to sample from. Also, those getting their masters or their doctorates sometimes have more financial aid from the school or perhaps don’t pay tuition at all; I am trying to focus specifically on students who are trying to attain their bachelor’s. I would sample ages 18-24, because the majority of public and private four-year institutions are made up of 18-24-year olds (Age Distribution of Undergraduate Students, by Type of Institution | The Hamilton Project, 2017). Socioeconomic status is irrelevant to sampling consideration but will be recorded in my survey. Same with language background; I will be recording what languages students speak and their first languages/languages spoken at home.
      </p>
    <h4>Are there any participants you would exclude? Why, why not?</h4>
      <p>I don’t think so, other than masters/doctoral students for reasons stated above–but even so, if a masters/doctoral student wanted to share their experiences with me, I would consider it. The undergraduate population is just likely to have been impacted more by the pandemic and how colleges/universities have responded to that, so it makes my sampling pool larger.
      </p>
   <h2>Design: What would the stimuli look like and why?</h2>
    <h4>Describe what kinds of manipulations/variations you would make or test for in order to test your hypothesis(es).</h4>
      <p>I think I could potentially send out a second survey with questions pertaining more to the responses I received during the first round. I think this would expand upon my initial data in a productive and specific way, as I would get more nuanced data the second time around. I could also do another round of focus groups, but group participants who expressed similar opinions in the same groups. I think this could provide an interesting support/rebuttal dynamic between a group that agrees with my hypothesis and one that does not.
      </p>
    <h4>Describe the factors you would vary if you were presenting a person with stimulus sentences.</h4>
      <p>I could vary my tone of voice or the casualness to which I present the questions, either in writing or vocally. In interviews, I could be more or less engaged with my participant to see if my chit-chat influences their thinking at all, which would be another interesting point of data on the topic.
      </p>
    <h4>Explain how varying these factors would allow you to confirm or disconfirm your hypotheses.</h4>
      <p>I think by presenting my questions in my surveys, interviews, and focus groups in a variation of ways would produce more varied data that could, perhaps, be better or worse for proving my hypothesis. Nonetheless, testing different forms and phrasing of the same questions would provide insight into the importance of context or attitude when discussing “attitudes towards” something (in this case, colleges/universities).
      </p>
    <h4>Explain what significant differences you would need to find to confirm or disconfirm your hypothesis(es). In particular, how could your hypothesis(es) be disconfirmed by your data?</h4>
      <p>My hypothesis would be disconfirmed if the majority of the participants thought college enrollment and tuition rates in the future would not be affected by the attitudes of students (high school and college-aged, alike). I think if I get an overwhelming disagreement, or even an overwhelming “I don’t know” or ambiguous answers, that will disconfirm my hypothesis. I would definitely air on the side of disconfirmation before I jump to confirmation. If the general attitude is yes, I would first need to code my data and pick out the themes as to why the attitude is yes… Then I can analyze the themes in the context of my hypothesis and see if it really confirms/disconfirms it. I would do the same procedure for my data if it looked like it was disconfirming my hypothesis, of course; I think that could also lead to an interesting generation of attitude themes, and provide areas for further study.
      </p>
    <h4>Controls: What kinds of factors would you need to control for in your study?</h4>
      <p>If I am going to vary my intonation or the phrasing of questions to alter my stimuli, I need to be consistent. I would say that I also need to make sure that the survey is only being taken by my target demographic, and that it is not being infiltrated somehow! I would have to figure out the nuances of that. I would also definitely need to control the length of each interview/focus group, as well as keeping the setting and set-up consistent. Maybe controlling the way I am dressed in these groups, to make sure I seem as neutral as possible to my participants.
      </p>
    <h4>Describe what types of effects would be likely to occur which would make your results appear to confirm, or to disconfirm your hypothesis(es).</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirmed: I think if I were able to code certain attitudes (like distrust, resentfulness, annoyance, frustration, confusion, anger, sadness/depression) out of my verbatim recordings of interviews/focus groups, coupled with similarities of attitude from the statistics of my survey(s), I would be able to confirm my hypothesis, maybe partially. This is a big question, and it’s hard to speculate how things will be years down the line; but getting a sense of the attitudes of students now could provide me with info on how to assess the attitudes of incoming generations of college students.
        <li>Disconfirmed: If I were able to code attitudes that oppose the attitudes that I believe would alter the functionality of colleges/universities, that would disconfirm my data. Like I said above, this could lead to an interesting future study of incoming potential students and if their attitudes align or differ from those who were already in college/university.
      </ul>
    <h4>Describe how you can by your design rule out or control for apparent effects.</h4>
      <p>Through extensive coding and theme-building, I would rule out/control apparent effects—by going through this coding/theme-ing process, I negate the opportunity for there to be an “obvious answer” from my collected data.
      </p>
   <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <h4>How are you going to present the stimuli?</h4>
      <p>Stimuli will be presented first as questions in a survey, most likely online. Stimuli will them be presented by myself in the format of an interview, in which I ask the participant questions, so I will be presenting vocally. The same goes for stimulus presented in focus groups; I will be prompting the group myself (vocally).
      </p>
    <h4>What is the participant in the experiment going to do?</h4>
      <p>Participants will answer my questions, either online through the survey, or vocally/non-verbally (if applicable) in interviews/focus groups. Their answers are my data, basically.
      </p>
    <h4>What is the step-by-step protocol?</h4>
      <h6>Survey</h6>
        <p>Participant-directed, I just provide them with the survey and they answer it themselves and submit it back to me. Once I have received enough responses (a number like 200 would be nice, but that will depend on the efficacy of my survey distribution), I will turn to coding analysis.
        </p>
      <h6>Interview</h6>
        <p>Participants will meet me at a determined time and location that I will inform them of through email (most likely) after they have signified interest in doing an interview. They will sign a consent form concerning the study (that I will have created) before the interview can ensue. Participants will sit across from me as I conduct the interview for the determined amount of time (no more than 20 minutes). I will begin recording our conversation right before I ask the first question. Questions will continue to be asked after the participant indicates that they are finished answering the question I have asked. After our interview is over, I will send them on their way with information on how to keep up with my study and where to contact me if they have further questions.
        </p>
      <h6>Focus Group</h6>
        <p>Participants will meet me at a determined time and location that I will inform them of through email (most likely) after they have signified interest in partaking in a focus group. They will sign a consent form concerning the study (that I will have created) before the focus group can ensue. Participants will sit facing each other; I will begin recording right before I ask the first question. I will ask the group 3-5 questions, and after asking a question I will let them talk amongst themselves until they indicate they are ready for the next question. The focus group will not exceed 45 minutes. After each focus group is over, I will send them on their way with information on how to keep up with my study and where to contact me if they have further questions.
        </p>
   <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <h4>How will you analyze the results?</h4>
      <p>Results will be analyzed through in-vivo coding of the verbatim transcriptions from the interviews and focus groups. Themes will then be compiled from each transcription and will be compared against each other to find the most common themes. Survey data will be statistically analyzed, and assessed for subgroups that could be subject to closer analysis.
      </p>
    <h4>What kind of results would confirm or disconfirm your hypothesis?</h4>
      <p>My thoughts on what results would confirm/disconfirm my hypothesis are articulated in section “Explain what significant differences you would need to find to confirm or disconfirm your hypothesis(es)” and “Describe what types of effects would be likely to occur which would make your results appear to confirm, or to disconfirm your hypothesis(es).”
