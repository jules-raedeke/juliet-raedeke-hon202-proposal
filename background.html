    <h1>Background and Literature Review</h1>
      <h2>“Student Attitudes Towards Online Education during the COVID-19 Viral Outbreak of 2020: Distance Learning in a Time of Social Distance” by Shem Unger and William R. Meiran, 2020</h2>
        <h4>Students at Wingate University were surveyed on the perceived impacts of the pandemic on their college education. 82 students across a wide range of majors were surveyed. 
          <ul>
            <li>75.6% of students “[…] expressed anxiety towards the sudden transition to strictly online distance learning and moving off campus” (Unger and Meiran, 2020). 
            <li>Some examples of student responses to survey questions pertaining to online learning are “’I’m really anxious about having all my classes online,’” “’Worried about how well I will retain information through online learning,’” and “’Even though the same information is provided, the attitude and desire to learn surrounding that information has been lost some’” (2020).
            <li>After 3 weeks of online learning, surveyed students filled out a follow-up survey concerning whether their anxiety about online learning had lessened or increased after those 3 weeks. 
          </ul>
          <p>These results are significant because they illustrate a picture of college students’ views on online learning due to the COVID pandemic, and how their attitudes toward their college education have shifted because of online learning. Moreover, these responses are significant because they were recorded in the spring of 2020, which indicates that these responses were felt as soon as there was a shift to online learning. This can also lead us to believe that these attitudes expressed in the above survey could only be amplified almost two years after the pandemic began. This notion suggests that another survey of college students’ attitudes towards higher education, in our current stage of the pandemic, would prove very insightful.
