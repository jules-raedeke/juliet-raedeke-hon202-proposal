    <h1>Background and Literature Review</h1>
      <h2>“Student Attitudes Towards Online Education during the COVID-19 Viral Outbreak of 2020: Distance Learning in a Time of Social Distance” by Shem Unger and William R. Meiran, 2020</h2>
        <h4>Students at Wingate University were surveyed on the perceived impacts of the pandemic on their college education. 82 students across a wide range of majors were surveyed.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>75.6% of students “[…] expressed anxiety towards the sudden transition to strictly online distance learning and moving off campus” (Unger and Meiran, 2020). 
            <li>Some examples of student responses to survey questions pertaining to online learning are “’I’m really anxious about having all my classes online,’” “’Worried about how well I will retain information through online learning,’” and “’Even though the same information is provided, the attitude and desire to learn surrounding that information has been lost some’” (2020).
            <li>After 3 weeks of online learning, surveyed students filled out a follow-up survey concerning whether their anxiety about online learning had lessened or increased after those 3 weeks. 
          </ul>
          <p>These results are significant because they illustrate a picture of college students’ views on online learning due to the COVID pandemic, and how their attitudes toward their college education have shifted because of online learning. Moreover, these responses are significant because they were recorded in the spring of 2020, which indicates that these responses were felt as soon as there was a shift to online learning. This can also lead us to believe that these attitudes expressed in the above survey could only be amplified almost two years after the pandemic began. This notion suggests that another survey of college students’ attitudes towards higher education, in our current stage of the pandemic, would prove very insightful.

       <h2>“Effects of COVID-19 on College Students’  Mental Health in the United States: Interview Survey Study” by Son et al., 2020</h2>
         <h4>249 students “[…] recruited from the student population of a large university system in Texas, United States” (Son et al., 2020) were interviewed about their mental health status a month after a stay-at-home order was issued in Texas in the beginning of April, 2020. These students took all-virtual classes.</h4>
           <ul>
             <li>71% of students interviewed “[…] indicated that their stress and anxiety had increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic” (2020). Moreover, “[…] at least 54% (up to 91% for some categories) of participants indicated negative impacts (either mild, moderate, or severe) of COVID-19 on academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related outcomes” (2020).
             <li>Academic performance – “In particular, participants stated their concerns about sudden changes in the syllabus, the quality of the classes, technical issues with online applications, and the difficulty of learning online” (2020). Some of the selected participant quotes for “academic performance” are “’It's so hard to focus on the lecture because everything is online. And I have to make appointments with a professor or a TA. Then they help me through the Zoom which is online. I think it's hard to have some understanding compared to the face to face meeting’” and “’The class I wanted to take over the summer has been canceled, which could potentially push me back a semester’” (2020).
             <li>Some of the selected participant quotes for “class workload” are “’[Professors] still want me to go to a Zoom class. Some of them still record those Zoom meetings and then you can watch it on your own time. It basically doubles the time I have to dedicate each week for that class’” and “’Four or five out of my six professors have given more work than I would have had if I was there in person. Some of them have to do with participation, just proving that you actually watch the lecture or take notes for the class’” (2020).
           </ul>
           <p>There were many more topics questioned in these interviews by Son et al., but for the purposes of my research, I focused on the academic/college student-specific ones. It is evident through the responses to interview questions (about academic performance and class workload) that students are frustrated by the current online nature of college. This is supported by complaints about lack of focus or understanding and increased workload due to a need for proof of participation or due to the online format. Other students expressed frustration about their graduation track and that they were being pushed back. These results are significant because, as observed in Unger and Meiran (2020), the attitudes of college students are severely shifting because of the pandemic and online learning. These responses indicate feelings of futility and inadequacy toward online learning, and the resulting disconnection between student and institution.
