      The future of college education in the United States is an extremely pertinent area of research, given our current state-of-the-world. With COVID persisting for years on end now, the college experience of undergraduates is being severely impacted.</br>
        </br>“In 2018–19, total revenues at degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States were $672 billion (in current dollars). Total revenues were $416 billion at public institutions, $242 billion at private nonprofit institutions, and $14 billion at private for-profit institutions” (COE - Postsecondary Institution Revenues, 2021).</br>
    </br>In 2021, students in the United States had $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. It is mind-blowing that in one year (2018-19), half of the United States’ student loans could be paid off by what colleges and universities profited. This total revenue was pre-pandemic, and still exorbitant. Tuition has only gone up since then; now, students can even be charged an “online fee” for taking classes remotely while the pandemic continues. Students are feeling more exploited than ever by the institutions they are paying for their education. This simply isn’t fair. An education should be a human right; when colleges continue to exploit and profit off of their students, they are sending the message that the former is not true.</br>
</br>The changing attitudes of students toward the practicality of college education could have serious impacts on the presence and function of these institutions in the United States. This could mean major job losses for those working at colleges and universities; thousands of instructors and professors would be out of work. In the same vein, the loss of students requiring student loans would heavily affect loan companies and their staff–the U.S. economy would definitely feel the impact.</br>
</br>Tons of people are financially riding on the exploitation of college and university students. It is important to study what would happen if we collectively recognized this, and caused a paradigm shift in the college system by rescinding enrollment and pushing back against this financial gouging.</br>
</br>By carrying out this proposed research on students’ attitudes toward college and college education, I believe an attitude shift in college students would be exposed. As students begin to understand that they are involved in an exploitative relationship with their schools, they are questioning the usefulness of a college degree. I think a publication on the shifting attitudes of college students would open the eyes of students and schools alike across the country. Publishing this research could spur on a student revolution in which those that willingly pay for their education stand up to colleges’ ludicrous tuition payments and lack of financial accommodation other than student-paid loans. It could also force colleges and universities to step back and rethink their financial model, as enrollment would suffer in light of a publication on widespread student dissatisfaction.
