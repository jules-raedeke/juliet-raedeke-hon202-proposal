      <div></br>My research proposal examines the future of college education in the United States. I feel this is an issue that is, in some capacity, on the minds of everyone involved in college education in the U.S. right now. The administrative and functional effects that COVID has had on colleges around the country has highlighted many issues within the institutions themselves. For example, having to pay exorbitant tuition fees for classes you can take from your kitchen table via Zoom.</br>

           </br>I strongly believe that we are about to witness a massive shift in attitude towards college education in the U.S., as well as a shift in how college and university institutions operate. The ever-growing vocationalization of the college degree has been exposed, and students are struggling to see a way in which a potential career from their degree will outweigh debilitating student debt. Colleges and universities, now more than ever, will have to work to meet the needs and wants from their student body in order to retain enrollment.</br>

           </br>This topic is significant to me because I am working towards a career in education, either as a high school teacher, or as a college instructor or professor. Observing the trends and details of the path that American college education is headed down now will be especially important, as it will shape the ways in which all educators think and speak about colleges and universities with their student body. The way a college education functions in the U.S. currently and how it could function in the future are essential for me to know as a future educator.</br></div>
